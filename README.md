# Feature-Selection-


I summarized the methods of feature selection and coded and integrated various methods on this basis. Some of them exist in sklearn, 
so I chose to integrate them with my other methods and use the same analysis method to complete the feature selection.


There are complete comments in the code. Very easy to understand ,You can use examples in sample.ipynb to see how to use it(with jupyter).
